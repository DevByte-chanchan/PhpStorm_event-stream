# PhpStorm Event-Stream Project

## What is Git? (Introduction to Git)
Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that helps developers manage their codebase by tracking changes, collaborating, and maintaining a history of the project.

### Why Use Git?
- **Version Tracking**: Git keeps track of every change made to files in a project. You can revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
- **Backup**: Changes are safely stored, and you can upload your code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
- **Conflict Resolution**: When two people modify the same file, Git highlights the conflict so it can be resolved before merging changes.

### Common Git Terms
- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory containing your project and the `.git` folder, which stores version history and metadata.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes saved to your local repository.
- **Branch**: A separate workspace to work on features or bug fixes without disturbing the main codebase.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
- **Pull**: Download changes from a remote repository.
- **Push**: Upload your commits to a remote repository.
